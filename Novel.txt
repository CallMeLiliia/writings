he narrator of The Great Gatsby is a young man from Minnesota named Nick Carraway. 
He not only narrates the story but casts himself as the book’s author. 
He begins by commenting on himself, stating that he learned from his father to reserve judgment about other people,
 because if he holds them up to his own moral standards, he will misunderstand them.
 He characterizes himself as both highly moral and highly tolerant. 
He briefly mentions the hero of his story, Gatsby, saying that Gatsby represented everything he scorns,
 but that he exempts Gatsby completely from his usual judgments. Gatsby’s personality was nothing short of “gorgeous.”
